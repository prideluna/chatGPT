# Supose i work with GCP, i have large datasets in bigquery and want develop some algoritm to get data to datastudio automaticaly, can you show me some machine learning code that i can use to automate this?

# Sure! Here is an example of a machine learning model that you can use to automate the process of getting data from BigQuery to Data Studio:

#     First, you will need to set up a connection to BigQuery in your GCP project. You can do this using the BigQuery Python client library.

#     Next, you will need to write a query to retrieve the data you want from BigQuery. This can be a simple SELECT * FROM my_dataset.my_table query, or it can be a more complex query that filters and aggregates the data in various ways.

#     Once you have your query results, you can use the Data Studio Python client library to write the data to a Data Studio report. This will typically involve creating a new Data Studio report, adding a data source to the report, and then adding a chart or table visualizing the data.

# Here is some sample code that demonstrates how you can do this:

from google.cloud import bigquery
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Set up a connection to BigQuery
client = bigquery.Client()

# Write your query
query = """
    SELECT * FROM `my_dataset.my_table`
"""

# Run the query and retrieve the results
query_job = client.query(query)
results = query_job.result()

# Convert the results to a pandas DataFrame
df = results.to_dataframe()

# Set up a connection to Data Studio
service = build('datastudio', 'v1')

# Create a new Data Studio report
report = service.reports().create(body={}).execute()
report_id = report['reportId']

# Add a data source to the report
data_source = {
    'name': 'My Data Source',
    'dataImportSettings': {
        'type': 'BIGQUERY',
        'bigquery': {
            'query': query,
        },
    },
}
data_source = service.reports().dataSources().create(
    reportId=report_id, body=data_source).execute()
data_source_id = data_source['dataSourceId']

# Add a chart to the report
chart = {
    'dataSourceId': data_source_id,
    'name': 'My Chart',
    'type': 'BAR',
    'xAxis': {
        'fieldName': 'x_field',
    },
    'yAxis': {
        'fieldName': 'y_field',
    },
}
service.reports().components().create(
    reportId=report_id, body=chart).execute()

# This code will run the specified query in BigQuery, convert the results to a pandas DataFrame, 
# create a new Data Studio report, add a data source to the report based on the query results,
#  and then add a bar chart visualizing the data to the report. You can customize the query, data source, and chart to meet your specific needs.
